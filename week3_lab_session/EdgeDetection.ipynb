    "# Edge detection\n",

    "In this lab exercise, you will look at applying edge detectors to images and comparing two different methods. You will also learn how to write a function in Python and evaluate the difference when using an approximation for the calculation of a parameter.\n",

    "At this stage, we will assume that you are able to use Python, and understand its basic use. **You are asked to write a short (no more than 2 pages) report of your work**, answering specific questions, and showing example images. This work is not assessed (it will not count towards your module mark) but you will get formative feedback.\n",

In this assignment we will be using [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/), [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Numpy](https://numpy.org/). We have also provided helper functions for displaying the images inline (utils.py). Check that your environment is configured correctly by running the section below. "
